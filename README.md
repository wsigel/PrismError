# PrismError
This is a prism demo out of the box. It shows the error in the android project (=> MainActivity.cs). The error
message is:

Android.Views.InflateException
  Message=Binary XML file line #1: Binary XML file line #1: Error inflating class androidx.appcompat.widget.Toolbar
  
Got this error with both Android 9 & 10

Even though this error is thrown the app compiles and runs.
